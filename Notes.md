Hopefully the stuff here (especially the enum's) is helpful, if not I can certainly look around some more. Feel free to lmk if you have any questions, c++ or
not.

### Enums
Here's some stuff on enum's, I tried to find multiple things on it, I think the first will be most helpful. 
Justus, if you expand the instructions menu, the second has good examples on how to do if-else/switch/etc with it.

### Pausing the Program

Maybe helpful if we want to clear the screen; this is Linux/Mac specific, so I'm not sure if it will work on onlinegdb... I feel like it would since the ASCII
sequences did though. I'll check it out later, but if one of you want to try it, here's how:

### Linux

Also, since you seemed interested in Linux, here's some info as well as the system I use (I have a lot of bookmarks...)

Dual booting: https://www.tecmint.com/install-linux-mint-alongside-windows-dual-boot-uefi-mode/

Various Linux tutorials and how to get started with things- very good site: https://itsfoss.com/

What I use: https://linuxmint.com/

Unlike Win/Mac, there are several different Linux distributions; Linux Mint is really user/beginner friendly; it's been my main system since I started using Linux (I care more about programming so I like my distros to be as easy as possible). It runs everything without issues- Chrome/Firefox/docx/xlsx/Zoom etc.
