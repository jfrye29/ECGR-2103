Do we have to show the current score for each player through the whole game or just during their turn? 

During the player's turn do we have to show the overall score or just the current score they have obtained through that turn? 

Do we need to run through every game for the demo including both 1 and 2nd player versions due to the time constraint?

For the game winning score, can we change it to 20 for demo purposes and change it back to 100 when we submit our code?
